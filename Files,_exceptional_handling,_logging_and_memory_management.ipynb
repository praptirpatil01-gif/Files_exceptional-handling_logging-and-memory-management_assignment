        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "* Interpreted languages:-In interpreted languages, the program is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, which makes them more flexible but generally slower.Interpreted languages are more portable because the same code can run on any system that has the interpreter installed.interpreted languages detect errors at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Compiled Languages:-Compiled languages, on the other hand, are converted into machine code before execution using a compiler, resulting in faster performance.compiled languages often need separate compilation for different platforms.compiled languages catch errors during the compilation stage.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to deal with runtime errors. Instead of stopping the program when an error occurs, Python allows developers to detect and handle exceptions gracefully using try, except, else, and finally. This improves program reliability and prevents unexpected crashes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "The finally block contains code that will always execute, whether an exception occurs or not. It is usually used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from a server. This ensures important operations are completed.\n",

        "Ans:-\n",
        "Logging is the process of recording events while a program runs. Python’s logging system helps developers store information about errors, warnings, and normal operations. Logging is useful for debugging, monitoring application behavior, and diagnosing problems in large software systems.\n",

        "Ans:-\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor, called automatically when an object is about to be deleted. It helps release external resources like file connections or network sockets. Although Python handles memory automatically, __del__ allows customized cleanup when objects are no longer needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Python allows several exception types to be caught using multiple except statements. This helps in handling different kinds of errors separately. Alternatively, developers can group multiple exceptions in one single except block using a tuple. This keeps the code clean and maintains accuracy in error management.\n",

        "Ans:-\n",
        "The with statement in Python ensures that a file is opened and automatically closed when the block ends. This avoids the need for manually calling file.close(). It also prevents resource leakage and ensures safe file operations even if an error occurs during file processing.\n",

        " * Multiprocessing :-\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing uses multiple processes , each with its own separate memory space , allowing true parallel execution. It is suitable for tasks that require heavy CPU usage. Multiprocessing avoids the GIL and provides better performance for CPU-intensive programs but consumes more memory.\n",

Logging can store information in files, which helps developers analyze behaviour and fix issues efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-Python uses an automatic memory management system. It manages memory allocations using a private heap, reference counting, and a built-in garbage collector. Python ensures memory is allocated efficiently to objects and released when the objects are no longer required.\n",

        "Q12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-Exception handling involves four key steps: placing error-prone code inside a try block, catching specific errors using except, optionally using an else block when no exception occurs, and using finally to perform cleanup. These steps allow safe and organized error management.\n",

        "Q13. Why Memory Management is Important in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "Q14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-The try block holds the code where an error might occur. If an error happens, Python jumps to the except block. The except block catches the exception and allows the program to continue running smoothly instead of stopping abruptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15.F How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-Python uses reference counting to track how many variables refer to an object. When the count becomes zero, the memory is released. Python also includes a cycle detector to identify and clear group of objects that refer to each other (circular references), ensuring efficient memory usage.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Q16.What is the purpose of the else Block in Exception Handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-The else block runs only if the try block executes without any exceptions. It is used to write code that should run only when everything goes correctly. This keeps the logic clean and separates normal operations from error-handling code.\n",

        "\n",
        "os.fork() is a low-level system call available mainly on Unix/Linux systems. It creates a child process by duplicating the current process. Both parent and child continue executing the same code after the fork. It is fast but less flexible and not available on Windows.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-Closing a file releases the file handler resource back to the system. It ensures all pending data is written to the file and prevents issues like file corruption or memory leaks. Leaving files open may cause errors in large systems.\n",
